# serial data reciever
It contains a serial data input, din, and a parallel data output, data(6:0). A clock signal is also 
needed at the input. Two supervision signals are generated by the circuit: 
err (error) and data_valid. When no bits are received, the din is ‘0’. The 
input data train consists of ten bits. A new bit is received at the rising 
edge of the clock. The first bit is a start bit, which, when high, must cause 
the circuit to start receiving data. The next seven are the actual data bits. 
The ninth bit is a parity bit, whose status must be ‘0’ if the number of 
ones in data is even or ‘1’ otherwise. Finally, the tenth is a stop bit, which 
must be high if the transmission is correct. An error is detected when 
either the parity does not check, or the stop bit is not a ‘1’. When 
reception is finished and if no error has been detected, then the data 
stored in the internal registers is transferred to the output data(6:0) and 
the output data_valid output is ‘1’ .

The steps of Design:
1. Make a simplify for design to easier its implementation
2. design for serial input parallel output register(SIPO)
3. define the i/p and o/p of design 
4. check if we need signal or not 
5. design the functions of problem 
6. design the mode of operation

-Assumptions: when we start receiving data, we set parameters:
 -data_valid→’0’ 
 -err→’0’
 -data(output) remains the same.
